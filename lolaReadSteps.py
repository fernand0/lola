# In any case this way of configuring the thing should allow us to easily
# reconfigure things. 
# The first three components are the legs of the right part of the robot
# (looking from behind) and the other three components correspond to the 
# legs of the left part of the robot. 
# The numbers correspond to the position in each part, from 1 to 3 (front,
# middle, rear).
